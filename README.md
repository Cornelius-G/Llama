#### Hi, I'm Llama and I will help you log your analyses so you can keep track of all of them.
<br/>

To use Llama you need to components: 
 - **The Llama Logger**, currently available for Python and Julia
 - **The Llama Vievwer**, an electron app to view the results of the logging available for Windows, macOS and Linux
